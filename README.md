# User Registration Webpage (IS333 - Spring 2025)  - web based

## Description
This project is a user registration system built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and AJAX for the Web-Based Information Systems Development course (IS333). It includes form validation, database integration, image upload, and an API-based WhatsApp number validation.

## Features
- **User Registration Form**: Collects full name, username, phone, WhatsApp number, address, password, confirm password, user image, and email.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Ensures required fields, correct data formats, and password security.
- **Server-Side Validation with AJAX**: Checks username availability dynamically.
- **User Image Upload**: Stores the image on the server and saves the filename in the database.
- **WhatsApp Number Validation**: Uses a third-party API to verify if the number is a valid WhatsApp number.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized PHP files for database operations, API handling, and UI components.
